## About

This GitHub repository has been created as the submission for group 1 (out of 2) of Team DTU for the Helsinki Deblur Challenge 2021. The Matlab functions and scripts in the repository implements an image deblurring algorithm with Point-Spread-Function (PSF) radius estimation. The algorithm is based on a paper written by our supervisors where they develop a CT-reconstruction method, which uses uncertainty quantification to estimate view angles using only measured CT data [Riis, N. A. B., Dong, Y. and Hansen, P. C.: Computed Tomography with View Angle
Estimation using Uncertainty Quantification. Inverse Problems, 37, pp. 065007, (2021)].

import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
